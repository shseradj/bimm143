# Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
pdbdb <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

```{r}
pdbdb
```

## Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
# Install tidyverse
# install.packages('tidyverse')
```

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbdb <- read_csv('Data Export Summary.csv')
```

```{r}
# characters changed in this table now
pdbdb
```

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$`X-ray`) / sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
sum(pdbdb$EM) / sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```

> 83.26% of structures in PDB are solved by X-Ray and 10.23% solved by electron microscopy.

## Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbdb$Total[1]/sum(pdbdb$Total) * 100
```

> 86.39% of structures in the PDB are protein (only protein).

## Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 4563 structures in the current PDB database.

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

We will use Mol and PDB code 1HSG.

```{r, fig.cap="Image of 1HSG from molstar"}
knitr::include_graphics("1HSG.png")
```

## Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
> Mol viewer is simplifying water molecules so they don't cluter the image and we can focus on the important structural information. 

## Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

```{r, fig.cap="Water 308 zoomed in"}
knitr::include_graphics("water.png")
```
Water molecule #308 is the conserved water molecule that is inside the binding site making important hydrogen bonds. 

## Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

```{r, fig.cap="HIV-protease chains with ASP 25 highlighted"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig3.png")

```

# Introduction to Bio3D in R\

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb('1hsg')
```

```{r}
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

## Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?
```{r}
sum(pdb$calpha)
```

There are 198 amino acid residues

## Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?
MK1

## Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```

Two unique chains, A and B. 

## Predicting functional motions of a single strucutre

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
adk
```
Performing flexibility prediction: 

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk.pdb")
```
