if file is [filename.tar.gz], have to unzip first, then untar.

# to unzip
gunzip [filename.gz]

# to untar 
tar -xvf [filename.tar] 

less [filename] to see what's in the file. e.g. less README.md
can also use more [filename]. 

./fastq-dump 
# gives you the version number
./fastq-dump --version 

# Prints out 
echo 
# where your commands are 
$ PATH

We need to add our new programs from the SRA toolkit to $PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/sratoolkit.3.1.1-ubuntu64/bin
Now the programs inside SRA bin can be called from anywhere. 

# run prefetch to download the data. it creates a directory with the SRR name.
prefetch SRR600956

# extract the fastq file (SRR600956.fastq)
fastq-dump SRR600956

# find @SRR600956 in the file. How many reads there. 
grep -c "@SRR600956" SRR600956.fastq

# opening some new datasets
fastq-dump --split-3 SRR2156848
grep -c "@SRR2156848" *.fastq

# we downloaded kallisto, unzip, untar, and add it to our path.
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/kallisto_linux-v0.44.0

# make a file (run.sh) with my 3 lines of code. The & makes it run in the background, faster/smarter.
